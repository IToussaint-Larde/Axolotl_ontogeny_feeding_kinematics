Axolotl_ontogeny_feeding_kinematics
This repository contains the data and code used in the manuscript entitled 'Adulthood is not an illusion! The impact of size and ontogeny on suction feeding kinematics in the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum).' 
More precisely:
'Toussaint-Larde_et_al_SCRIPT_data_extraction.R' is the code used to facilitate the extraction of the kinematic variables measurement from the csv file created by deeplabcut (dlc). Sometimes values have to be found manually by the operator in the dlc csv file or need interpretation with the help of the original video.
'data_Ambystoma_mexicanum.csv' contains the kinematic variables measurement, the SVL and developmental stages of the individuals for each feeding sequences.
'Toussaint-Larde_et_al_SCRIPT_statistical_analysis.R' is the code used to perform the statistical analysis on 'data_Ambystoma_mexicanum.csv' and to create the figures.

All code is written in the R language (R Core Development Team, 2023). If you use these data, please cite Toussaint-Lard√© et al., 2025.
